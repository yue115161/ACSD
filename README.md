# ACSD
The code of paper "A reliable matching algorithm for heterogeneous remote sensing images considering the spatial distribution of matched features"

This code is written in C#. If you only use this code for image matching, you only need to run the ACSD_CSDN Release.exe file in the "ACSD_CSDN Release\bin\x64\Debug" directory. If you need to change the code, please use the Visual Studio platform (I am using Visual Studio2017). The code uses the ACSD algorithm (paper: A reliable matching algorithm for heterogeneous remote sensing images considering the spatial distribution of matched features). Its main feature is that it can handle matching pairs with a high outlier rate (it can handle an initial accuracy of 0.07 Matching pairs) to obtain matching results with higher accuracy. You are welcome to cite my paper. If you have any questions, please contact meand I will reply as soon as possible . Commercial use of this code is prohibited. I wish you all a happy life and successful scientific research!

Welcome predecessors and peers to use this algorithm for comparison and reference.
I wish you all a happy life and a smooth scientific research!
